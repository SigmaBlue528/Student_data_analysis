Student data analysis

Overview of the Student data analysis
The purpose of this exercise is to determine the metrics and statistics for several high schools in each state. The analysis will be looking into the number of students, their respective reading and writing scores, the type of schools that are attended, as well as the budget that is currently allocated to the schools by type (public or charter).

Analysis Results:
The analysis revealed that there is no significant difference in reading and writing scores when differentiated by type. The high school with the highest student count was discovered to be Montgomery Highschool with a total head count of 2,038 students and the high school with the lowest number of students was discovered to be Chang High school with a total head count of 171 students. It was also discovered that charter schools have a lower budget of $87,262,565.66 than district (public) schools with an allocated budget of $91,119,555.83. 

Student data analysis Summary:
This analysis might appear to insinuate that public schoolâ€™s funding should be matched to that of charter schools. It is our recommendation that public schools be given a larger budget. The rationale for this is that the analysis was too narrowly focused on reading and mathematics skills. Yes, in theory, the world requires that students be proficient in reading and math to be successful and productive members of society; there are also many other metrics that were not considered. Just because a student can read and do math does not meant that they have real world skills such as critical thinking or critical thinking skills. If anything, all we are doing by focusing on such binary metrics is merely that they can regurgitate the information they have been provided. It is in our opinion that public schools should be allocated more funding and that in five years that the analysis should be conducted again this time taking into consideration the students scores in other subjects. If the KPIs for public schools have not changed then and only then should the budget be cut to that of charter schools.
